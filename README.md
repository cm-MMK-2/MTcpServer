# [MTcpServer](https://github.com/cm-MMK-2/MTcpServer/)
A C++ tcp server library built on top of [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv)(current version:1.20)

## Build
Compiler supporting C++ 14 is required.

## Example
Please also check the example.cpp file
```
MTcpServer server;
server.Setup("0.0.0.0", 9000);
//server.SetShortConnection(true);//if you want to close connection after response(like http server)
server.on_new_session = [](MClientSession& session) {
  //new session connected
};
server.on_new_packet = [](MClientSession& session, char * data, ssize_t len) {
  //new message from session received
};
server.on_session_close = [](MClientSession& session) {
  //client disconnected
};
server.Start();
```
